<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    My name is Diego Paz, and I was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 24 years ago. I graduated in Chemical Engineering in<br>
    2023, and have been working on my Masters Degree in Agricultural Engineering since then. I have an interest in tech-<br>
    nology, and have been studying a little of programming in my university journey, mostly Python. Recently, though, I <br>
    have started to learn web development, which has led me to the creation of this website as a first capstone by using<br>
    the html knoewledge I've acquired so far.
</p>
<p>
    I look forward to the websites I will be able to create in the future! From now on, I am going to continue studying as<br>
    much as I can.<br>
